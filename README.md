Building Cyanogenmod Compiler
------------------
Its very easy to build the cyanogenmod compiler, if you ever want to test before a release. Just follow a simple guideline to build for each device.
Types:

    all
    32
    64
    cmc-VERSION-TYPE (ex. cmc-12.04-64)
  
Once you know the type, just run make and type.

    make TYPE (ex. make all)

Thank for using the cyanogenmod compiler.
